# RunOS terminal server (runostty) release runbook: deterministic, fail-fast, automation-friendly.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release.sh v0.2.0          # full release
#   scripts/release.sh v0.2.0 --check  # run every gate, stop before tag/push (no side effects)
#   make release RELEASE_VERSION=v0.2.0
#
# What it does, in order (any failure aborts before the tag is created):
#   1. Preflight   - tools present, VERSION well-formed, tag not already taken,
#                    CHANGELOG has a matching section, working tree clean & synced,
#                    CI green on the exact commit,
#                    sensitivity scan (PUBLIC repo: fail closed on secret-shaped
#                    content in the deploy payload).
#   2. Code gates  - leak gate (PUBLIC repo: whole-tree scan for credentials and
#                    un-baselined internal identifiers, cannot be skipped), then
#                    package.json version matches the tag, npm ci, npm run check
#                    (tsc, eslint, prettier) and npm test (the unit suite).
#   3. Deploy      - tag the dev commit and push the tag + dev. main is NOT
#                    touched (the human merges main after personal verification).
#   4. CI watch    - wait for the Release workflow run for this tag to succeed.
#   5. Attest      - verify the published image's build-provenance attestation is
#                    bound to release.yml @ this repo.
#   6. Record      - only after a successful deploy, through
#                    scripts/deploy/record-release.sh: a candidate fast-forwards
#                    the `deployed` branch to the shipped commit. A FINAL
#                    fast-forwards `deployed` and then `main`, the prod record, to
#                    the commit its tag names. Fast-forward only: a diverged
#                    branch is refused and nothing is forced.
#
# Branch model: dev = local development (the tagged commit); deployed = the last
# commit that was tagged, candidate or final (advanced on success); main = the
# prod record, moved only by a final, to the final's commit. A final also needs
# main to be an ancestor of dev, which the preflight checks before any tag exists.
#
# The release publishes the artifact (image); it does NOT roll any live cluster.
# A workspace pod runs the image its cluster's conductor names (a floating tag):
# :dev moves on a release candidate, :latest on a final.
#
# The integration tests need Docker, so they are not run here. The CI gate in the
# preflight requires the CI workflow, which runs them, to be green on the commit.
